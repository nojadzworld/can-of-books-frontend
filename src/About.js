    return <p>After serving in the US Navy for 8 years, as a leading supervisor you tend to get many experiences. Having over 90 sailors to provide guidance and technical expertise support. To now taking technical support to another level, following a long-lost dream of computers and their make-up. The under-lining language behind the finished product of any technology has always been something that really intrigued my interest. Being a Dev has allowed me to move into the direction of understanding and not only has it dressed an open wound, but it has actually showed me that there really isn't a wound at all. Every Role that I am blessed to fulfil I do so at the highest of standards and leave absolutely no doubts of prosperity. </p>
